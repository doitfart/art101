			<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge or goal of this lab was to continue practicing creating local file structures on our computers, to add index.html files, and then to upload them to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only issues I had were related to the image. First, I couldnt figure out how to change the file type from HEIF (photo taken on my freinds old digital camera)but then I remembered from the lecture that theres a way to convert the image to .jpeg from my mac. Second, I couldnt remember how to import a photo to a folder on VSCode, but I discovered you can also just drag and drop files into the img folder. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The site you are currently viewing is the index.html file that I created. This image is the file structure I have within VSCode:</p>

					<p>Screenshot of html code for art101/index.html, aka my homepage:</p>
					<img src="img/task2sc.png" width="1000">
					<p>Screenshot of art101/index.html, my homepage, in my browser as a local file:</p>
					<img src="img/task2sc2.png" width="1000">
					<p>Screenshot of the lab3/index.html which makes up this site. Note: Screenshot taken before these images and captions were coded into the lab3/index.html: </p>
					<img src="img/task3sc.png" width="1000">
					<p>Screenshot of this site that you can view by scrolling up, included because instructions said to "add all of your screenshots...and caption them."</p>
