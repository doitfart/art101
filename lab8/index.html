                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The goal or challenge of this lab was to further familiarize ourselves with JavaScript by experimenting with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>Only issue I had was with the "result" variable as the example code had "result" used by two different functions, so that when the second function was executed, it overwrote the first. All i did was change the result in the second function from "result" to "result2," so you can reference each and get both results after all the code has run. Additionally, my console was just saying "Array (number of elements in array)" when it was supposed to log the array/results in the console. It does this everytime i open the console, but mysteriously, refreshing the page causes the actual elements/results to display. </p>
