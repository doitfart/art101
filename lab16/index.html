                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this lab is to further our understanding of JavaScript by experimenting with processing JSON from an API.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>For a while after I had finished coding, I ran into the CORS block issue where the XKCD API was blocking my code from fetching data. I deleted and reinstalled the CORS unblock extention and tried a different extension, all to no avail. Turns out, the extension wasnt "on," despite it being enabled. I knew for a fact my code was right, and it turns out it was not an issue with my work. Only other issue I had was that the alt text and image wouldnt load because I didnt have a space after the quotation mark and before the 'alt=,' so I put a space there because the error code was saying that it couldnt  retrieve the file that ended in "...jpgalt=" which told me where my error was (again, a space before 'alt='). Other than that, this lab was pretty easy.</p>
