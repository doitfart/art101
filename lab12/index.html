                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this lab was to delve even further into our understanding of JavaScript by creating a function that depends on conditionals. </p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I ran into only a few problems with this lab, but my main area of confusion was with implementing jQuery into the JS code. Using the stuff we learned from the previous lecture and lab on jQuery, I thought I could just replace every document.getElementById(id) with the jQuery $("#id"). For whatever reason, this did not work, and prevented any of my JavaScript from working, so I removed them in favor of the classic "document" commands allowed my code to actually work. I want to know why this didnt work because I would much rather type the $ jQuery commands than the document ones to save myself time, work, and stress. </p>
