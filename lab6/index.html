					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge or goal of this lab was to further practice JavaScript by experimenting with arrays and objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem I had was with the "return" statement and "this" keyword in JavaScript. I had only first seen it on the lab 6 tasks, and I was kind of confused about it logically. Googling "return" and hovering over "this" in VScode provided me with the help I needed - "return" is used to get something from the code/console (I think) and "this" is just used to tell the code to grab whatever element that follows it from the object "this" is contained within. </p>
