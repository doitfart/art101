//Creating a HangMan game:
//Generate a random 4 letter word and store it in the variable
//Display the length of the 4 letter word to the user //Correct guess is less than the length of the word
//Prompt the user to quess a letter
  //If guessed correct
    //increment the correct guess by 1
  //If guessed incorrect
    //increment the incorrect guess by 1
    //Draw part of the hangman with each incorrect guess by 1
//If guessed more than 2 time incorrectly, 
  //inform the user
//If all letters are guessed correctly
//When they lose exit the program
