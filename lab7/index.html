                    <p>The goal or challenge of this lab is to write functions that take user input and to manipulate strings in JavaScript.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>My partner and I didnt really run into any issues for this lab. I was kind of confused by Wes' note that our lines of JS methods we used to split and join the input could be consolidated into one line, so I inspected his lab 7 site to see if he used it there, but he didnt. I fiddled around with it in the console, and it works, but I think this might be a case of clever vs clear code, so I stuck with my un-consolidated lines of code.</p>
